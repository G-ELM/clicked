# Documentation Index

Every document in this repository, grouped by what you are trying to do rather than by
where the file happens to live. Each entry has a one-line description so you can pick the
right document without opening several first.

If you are new here, follow [Start here](#start-here) and ignore the rest until you need it.

> **Maintenance:** this index must be updated whenever a document is added, moved, or
> removed. A new `.md` file that is not listed here is effectively invisible — the whole
> point of this file is that it is exhaustive. See [Keeping this index honest](#keeping-this-index-honest).

## Start here

A first-time contributor should read these four, in this order. It is roughly an hour and
it is enough to make a scoped change and open a pull request.

1. [Root README](../README.md) — what Clicked is, the tech stack, and how to install and
   run the whole monorepo locally with `pnpm` and `docker compose`.
2. [System architecture overview](architecture-overview.md) — one diagram showing how the
   four apps and the external services fit together, plus two end-to-end request traces.
3. The one app doc for the area you are touching — pick your entry point from
   [By role](#by-role) below.
4. [Contributing guidelines](../README.md#-contributing) — branch naming, commit style,
   and the pull request process.

> **Note:** the contribution guidelines currently live in the "Contributing" section of the
> root README rather than in a top-level `CONTRIBUTING.md`. If a dedicated `CONTRIBUTING.md`
> is added later, this step and the link above should point at it instead.

| [Delivery fan-out and receipts](../apps/backend/docs/concepts-delivery-fanout.md)                        | How one sent message reaches every recipient device, how receipts flow back, and which services are not actually wired into the live path. |

### Frontend developer

The Next.js client in `apps/web`. It holds the private keys, so most of its documentation
is about encryption and local state.

## Keeping this index honest

This file is the only entry point into the documentation, which means a document missing
from it is a document nobody will find.

- **Adding a document:** add a row to the section matching the _reader_ who needs it, not
  the directory it lives in. If two roles need it, list it under both — duplication across
  role sections is intentional, since each section is meant to be read on its own.
- **Moving or deleting a document:** update or remove its row in the same commit. A broken
  link here is worse than no link.
- **Adding a new area:** if a new app or subsystem arrives with its own `docs/` directory,
  give it its own role section rather than appending to an existing one.

The scope of this index is every `.md` file in the repository except generated output and
dependency directories (`node_modules/`, `target/`, `.venv/`, build artefacts).
